### data-science-first-steps

This is a list of several projects I worked on during my time as a data science student at General Assembly.
The scope of the projects ranges from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization of results (using seaborn, matplotlib, folium, etc), Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Methods), Web Scrapping, etc.
