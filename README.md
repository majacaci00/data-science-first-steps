### data-science-first-steps
This is a list of various notebooks I worked during my time as a data science student at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/san-francisco)
The scope of the projects ranges from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization of results (using seaborn, matplotlib, folium, etc), Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Methods), Web Scrapping, etc.
