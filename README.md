### data-science-first-steps
This is a list of various notebooks I worked during my time as a data science student at [General Assembly][1]
The scope of the projects ranges from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization of results (using seaborn, matplotlib, folium, etc), Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Methods), Web Scrapping, etc.
